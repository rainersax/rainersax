### Digital Consulting & Experience Strategy

I am a Product Designer, Digital Consultant, Experience Strategist. As a trained philosopher and logician I love to work with  words and abstract concepts. As a former developer and tech lead I still enjoy the technical side of things.

Most of the time I am involved very early on, often when a project is just emerging. It is part of my job to challenge assumptions, broaden the horizon only to narrow things down again and set the whole  thing on track.

Sometimes this process continues, especially when we are dealing with a more complex digital product development process where business and user experience strategy have to be followed through even beyond implementation.

Recently I have been working as a consultant supporting teams setting up digital development projects and advising on strategic operational aspects e.g. finding the right communicational artefacts, dealing with expertise driven decision making in diverse interdisciplinary teams or really just the kind of craftsmanship that comes with 20+ years experience.

I have sold cars, shoes, insurance, financial products etc. online. I have developed campaigns and platform communication. I have created pure software products but also completely offline service design experiences. Recently I have become involved with the digital extension and transformation of industrial products and I would be very happy to do more of that.
